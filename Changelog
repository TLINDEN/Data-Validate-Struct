	o applied patches by Per Carlson:
	  - don't die on 1st error, rather collect them and
	    and issue a full report
	  - use errors() to retrieve all those collected errors
	  - enhanced unit tests
	  - proper utf8 handling
	  - lots of minor tweaks (typos, ambuities and such)

0.07
	o lost [updated 11/2014]

0.06
	o fixed t/run.t, it used still the old name, all tests
	  failed therefore.

	o replaced some of the built-in regexes with methods
	  of Data::Validate(the real one :-) ).

	o added 2 new types: hex and oct.


0.05
	o well, against renamed it to Data::Validate::Struct,
	  because Data::Validate already exists.

	o removed chack for 'resolvablehost' because some cpantesters
	  failed to run it.


0.04
        o renamed Config::General::Validate to Data::Validate
          because this tells much better what it does.

	o started with 0.x version numbering to show the
	  early stage of the module.
	
	o added ipv6 type

	o fixed several bugs with existing types. Thanks to
	  David Cantrell for some very useful hints.

	o added more documentation.
